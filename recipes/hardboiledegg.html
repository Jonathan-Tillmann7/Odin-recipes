        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>An easy to make recipe (duh) for some hardboiled eggs! They're not for everyone, but don't knock it till you've tried this recipe!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An egg (simple enough right?)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Add the eggs to a saucepan and cover with water:</h4>
                <p>Fill a saucepan about a quarter of the way with cold water. Place the eggs in a single layer at the bottom of the saucepan. Add more water so that the eggs are covered by at least an inch or two of water.</p>
                <p>The more eggs that are crowding the pan the more water you should have over the eggs. 6 eggs should be covered by at least an inch, 7 to 12 eggs, 2 inches.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Bring to a rolling boil:</h4>
                <p>Leave the pan uncovered. Turn the heat to high and bring the water to a rolling boil.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Turn off the heat, cover, and let sit:</h4>
                <p>Depending on how cooked you like your hard boiled eggs, the eggs should be done perfectly after sitting for 10-12 minutes. That said, depending on your altitude, the shape of the pan, the size of the eggs, and the ratio of water to eggs, it can take a few minutes more.</p>
                <p>Or if you like your eggs not fully hard cooked, it can take a few minutes less. When you find a time that works for you, given your preferences, the types of eggs you buy, your pots, stove, and cooking environment, stick with it.</p>
                <p>I also find that it is very hard to overcook eggs using this method. I can let the eggs sit, covered, for up to 15-18 minutes without the eggs getting overcooked.</p>
            <li>
                <h4>Strain and run under cold water:</h4>
                <p>Strain the hot water from the pan, careful not to dump out the eggs, and run cold water over them until they are cool to the touch. This will stop the eggs from cooking further and make them easier to peel.</p>
                <p>
                    Or, if you are cooking a large batch of eggs, remove them with a slotted spoon to a large bowl of ice water. Let them sit for a few minutes, or until cooled.</p>
                <li>
                    <h4>Peel or store for later:</h4>
                    <p>I find it easiest to peel the eggs under a bit of running water.</p>
                    <p>The best way to store hard boiled eggs is unpeeled in a covered container in the refrigerator. Eggs can release odors in the fridge which is why it helps to keep them covered.</p>
                    <p>They should be eaten within 5 days. Peeled eggs should be eaten within a day or two.</p>
